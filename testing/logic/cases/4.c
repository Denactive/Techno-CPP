this test is similar to the previous one tets (i ment test)

but here we can see a test for double and single quotes


"//this is a test!"

'//this is a test!'
probably, sintex here is not correct, isn't it? (this second quote is required to close a comment ')
thus, it is a test
annswer is 6!
//this is a test!
//this is a test!
